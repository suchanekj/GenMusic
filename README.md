# Installation
* intall python2.7
* use pip (.../python2.7/scripts/pip.exe) to install all mising packages
* install ffmpeg (if adding to path doesnt work, download the static bulid and move it in
to the project folder)
* disable microphone and enable stereo mix (or however it is called on your device) to feed
sound output as an imput for the mp3 file
* i personaly prefer to work with pycharm, there is a free version or you can get a student
licence if you have an ISIC
