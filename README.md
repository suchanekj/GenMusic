# Installation
* install python2.7 and python3.6
* install pygame using pip for python2.7
* install mido, deap, MIDIutil using pip for python3.6
* Install keras with tensorflow https://keras.io/#installation for python3.6
* install ffmpeg (if adding to path doesnt work, download the static build and move it in
to the project folder)
* disable microphone and enable stereo mix (or however it is called on your device) to feed
sound output as an input for the mp3 file
* i personally prefer to work with pycharm, there is a free version or you can get a student
licence if you have an ISIC
* It is a good idea to install a better sound font as the one preinstall at the sound card 
is usually quite bad, you need a virtual midi synthetizer 
(e.g. https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth#download) and a soundfont,
I personaly use Timbers of Heaven (http://midkar.com/soundfonts/index.html), a thorough list
is at http://www.synthfont.com/links_to_soundfonts.html
* If you wish to view or edit the outputted MIDI you can use e.g.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ariamaestosa/
* It supposes that the command "python" points to python2.7 and not python3.*, you can do that
by calling python.exein Python36 python3.exe
